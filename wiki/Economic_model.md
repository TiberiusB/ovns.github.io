An *open value network* embodies new processes for creation and capturing of value. The underlying economic model depends on the [[type of value network]].  

This page only contains general considerations.

# About resources
OVNs are *unbounded structures* when it comes to [[resources]]. Since the network is transparent (in terms of access to information) and open (in terms of access to participation), it can always attract new [[affiliates]] who are willing to make different types of [[contributions]]: time, cash, materials (tools and equipment, physical spaces), social capital, etc. In that sense, the network is not bounded by a limited pool of [[resources]] (budget or a given number of employees) like classical organizations are. Its [[resources]] can expand very dynamically according to needs and incentives.

## Types of resources
**See also [[Resource types]]** in the context of the [[value accounting system]]

### Human resources
Open value networks (OVN) are open and transparent and run on an Internet-based platform. OVNs that focused on high tech products or software for example operate on the **[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail] long tail mode of production**, meaning that they can integrate a large number of agents distributed across the planet. In other words, their pool of participants is practically the entire population of the world with access to Internet. 

See also the [[Role system]], [[Reputation system]]  - [NOTE to participants: expand on this...] [[Talk:Economic_model|discussion for this page]]

**Incentive system**

The OVN embodies an incentive system with which it sends specific signals designed to remind network [[affiliates]] about the connection between their efforts, or their [[contributions]], and the benefits awaiting them ([[fluid equity]] for example), as they perform activities. The function of this system is to build and maintain awareness about the meaning and the importance of each member’s actions. It is designed to make [[affiliates]] conscious about why they are doing what they are doing. 

Affiliates of an actual OVN (like [[SENSORICA]]) have expressed multiple interests in the network because of the **extrinsic incentives** that the system can provide. First, the OVN gives affiliates entrepreneurial opportunities to generate [[revenue]]. It uses a [[value accounting system]] to record [[contributions]] (time, cash, materials...) and a [[value equation]] to build a piechart of relative [[contributions]] to [[[projects]], representing fluid equity in [[projects]]. This piechart is used to redistribute [[revenue]] generated by [[projects]] that reach maturity (through market exchanges). Second, an OVN offers a variety of valuable assets. The most important ones come from access to other affiliates’ skills and material resources. Its affiliated labs offer expensive tools and equipment as well as other material assets that can be shared within the network’s collaborative space. Third, the OVN offers a context for technical and scientific research. Some [[SENSORICA]] affiliates for example have already generated publications from their work within the network. Since [[SENSORICA]] has been already awarded a few prizes, all members are more or less associate with these victories. 

More importantly, an OVN offers affiliates **intrinsic incentives** for joining the network. First, affiliates are driven by the interest or enjoyment in the tasks they take, without being subject to any external pressure. Second, working within an OVN helps them learn and satisfy their curiosity. Third, the OVN uses *recognition* as reward. The recognition plays an important role in harmonizing and stabilizing the value network. Furthermore, the recognition has a higher positive impact when members are publicly acknowledged. The OVN is a collaborative environment, a tight network where individuals can share and help each other at many levels. Within an OVN individuals are treated as peers. Also, since the OVN is transparent (in terms of access to information) it is also forced to be ethical. Openness (in terms of participation) makes the network grow around widely accepted values. For this reason, [[projects]] are often attached to solving important social problems.

### Currency
OVNs exchange the value they create with the market through the [[Exchange firm]]. Different exchange mechanisms can be used: barter systems or different types of currencies. Tangible value that flows back into the network is called [[revenue]]. All revenue is immediately redistributed to network affiliates according to their [[fluid equity]], using the [[value accounting system]]. A portion of that goes to maintain the infrastructure. Network affiliates use a portion of their revenue to invest back into projects, as a *financial* [[contribution]].  

### Shared material assets
See [[Pool of shareables]]

### Knowledge commons
See [[Commons]]

## Resource allocation
An OVN is decentralized in terms of allocation of resources. In other words, most of the resources needed to create and distribute value is given by affiliates, in the form of investment. Like in traditional open source projects, every affiliate decided where to allocate resources for reasons that are purely individual and/or collectively agreed upon. 
There is no development budget within OVNs. 

The [[Pool of shareables]] is a centralized pool of resources, but only centralized in terms of ownership (it belongs to a custodian) not in terms of governance or allocation. The rules for access (to use) are decided by the network through some democratic process. The network also decides how much to allocate for maintenance, replenishment, and new acquisitions of shared material assets. The maintenance and management is also done by the network, meaning that part of the budget allocated for managing shareables goes back to members who participate in maintenance and management activities. The custodian is not allowed to exploit these shareables (extract rent or generate revenue by using them in any way shape or form).

# About entrepreneurship

## Products and services
OVNs are transparent in terms of access to information about products and internal processes. That erases the informational asymmetry often seen between corporations and their market. This informational asymmetry gives raise to abuse, higher prices and unethical processes. Among other things, this makes possible programmed obsolescence and deliberate environmental negligence. On the other side, transparency incites for better practices and increases accountability. In the current economy, OVNs can capitalize their higher ethical standards, which are a corollary of their openness and transparency, and can charge a premium on their products, to recover a portion of the loss due to informational asymmetry. 

Because of transparency the product design philosophy fits better the widely accepted norms. Openness, which allows a larger participation to the design process can result in products of higher value (higher quality, user friendly, environmentally friendly, interoperable, etc.). 

See [SENSORICA's product design philosophy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbfyREvQKAtkdz24_NVzosf4f5t6WatMPy5mDsbD0PA/pub) document.

## Clients
The OVN integrates a lot of feedback from clients by maintaining an open communication channel with them, like in the case of open source projects with users. Clients are also invited to become contributors to the network, or network affiliates. Unlike traditional companies, OVNs reward feedback through the [[value accounting system]] in a tangible way, if this feedback adds value to the network in a tangible way (in terms of product design, improvement of internal processes, etc.). 

## Strategy
add content...

## Organizational design
[[File:Organizational model.JPG|frameless|right|created by SENSORICA]]

The OVN is designed to be a commons-based production system in which a network of members work together to create and market products under a Creative Commons license commons. The knowledge on which commons products are built is open. Most processes within the OVN  are in the open and transparent to outsiders.

Although the OVN’s products are created by individual members, the exchange with the market must be performed in the name of the community, for the community. Members are not allowed to complete transactions with the market. Rather, they have to pass through an [[Exchange firm]]. This policy helps alleviate two problems. First, members might be tempted to cheat for large deals and not disclose the full amount. The Exchange firm allows the community to know exactly the market value the product service is exchanged for. Second, some members can monopolize the interface with the market, through which they can gain disproportionate influence within the community. The Exchange firm facilitates members’ interface with the market and ensures that members have equal chance to access the market. 

None of the members is paid any salary but they share profits from successfully commercialized products and can conduct their own business outside the OVN. Contributors of each product collectively decide the value of each type of contribution and thus the share of the revenue. These contributors are called [[affiliates]]. Anyone who promises to create a product or to increase the market value of an existing product can become an active affiliate. Active affiliates are individuals or organizations with resources and technical skills (e.g., hardware, software, optics, biology, etc.) as well as business skills (e.g., marketing, accounting, community building, etc.) that take part in the business cycle of a product from R&D (research and development) to sales and after sales service. However, people offering simple services only are not eligible to become active members. For example, machining a mechanical piece from a 3D model made by an active affgiliate does not quality the service provider to be an active affiliate because this service does not increase the market value of the product. 

The OVN may produce a lot of commons but only some of these products are expected to have real market values. Affiliates are not awarded for ideas or non-used products/processes. They get [[revenue]] only when the final products get sold. Product development as well as financing and marketing the final product are the responsibility of active affiliates. Any affiliate can take the lead at his/her own initiative at any stage of the value chain from product development to distribution. Active affiliates must assume the task of persuading other affiliates to engage in their project and/or use the results of their work in the next activities in the value chain. At any stage of the value chain, active affiliates can decide whether source/develop upon an existing product/process from within the OVN or from the market. On the same token, they can decide to sell their work at any stage or get their work used in the next stage. It should be noted that only work whose results get used is compensated when revenue flows back to the value chain. OVN affiliates understand that failure is a part of R&D processes and thus failures for good causes are rewarded by in the form of reputation building. Furthermore, activities with high risks of failure are given higher weight in the [[value equation]] with which active affiliate calculate the share of each affiliate’s contribution toward the product/process sold.

Redistribution of revenues from each product is calculated by the OVN’s [[value accounting system]] – a part of the OVN’s [[infrastructure]] entirely under the control of OVN’s active affiliates. The value accounting system is made of the value, reputation and role systems that interact with each other (Figure 2).

Each affiliate's activity types are recorded in a [[role system]]; the quantity of each member’s [[contribution]] is recorded in a value system; and the value of each contribution is quantified a [[value equation]] collectively decided by contributors of the product. The role of affiliates within the network is emergent (it is not assigned). As a result, the [[role system]] incites voluntary subordination and is important for self-organizing. The reputation of each affiliate is the result of peer-evaluation, by all other affiliates, taking into consideration the role played. The evaluation focuses on performance, behavior, drive, etc. The reputation is connected to the value system and affects the ability of an affiliate to extract value from the network. The reputation system incentivizes good behavior within the network and helps to focus attention. Therefore, the reputation system plays an important role in the creation and the flow of value within the network by filtering participants for adequate tasks. [[SENSORICA]]’s experience with this value accounting system has been positive.

# Growth model

## Network level

An OVN grows by affiliation. It's size is only limited by coordination. 
In terms of infrastructure, for every project that creates [exchange value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_value) a [[value accounting system]] is used to describe how value amalgamates into a product. Products of some projects can represent inputs for other projects, in which another [[value accounting system]] is used.

## Network of networks level

The infrastructure of OVNs is designed to be applied to fractal structures, or [[Network of Networks]]. An OVN can be considered as an individual contributor in a project in another OVN . Some have used the term super-value network. In theory, the OVN concept can be applied to the entire global economy. 

We are thinking about value accounting at the project level, which is federated at the network level and use a protocol for inter-network exchanges and co-creation. 


We observed around [[SENSORICA]] 2 growth modes for [[Network of Networks]]. 
1. **by affiliation** - independent networks that already exist affiliate with other networks. See work on the [Open Alliance](http://www.sensorica.co/home/working-space/labonline-network/montreal-labonline/project-vie/the-open-alliance).
2. **by incubation and spin off** - individuals with project ideas join a network, grow their projects which grow into networks, use local resources to develop and are spun off once they reach critical mass. This is the case with [Drone](http://www.sensorica.co/home/projects/sensor-technology-to-support-local-food-systems/drone-project) and [3D Printing](http://www.sensorica.co/home/projects/3d-printer-project) projects in SENSORICA. 


We are now thinking about giving OVNs the internal mechanisms to nest and incubate embryo networks to be spun off later.
