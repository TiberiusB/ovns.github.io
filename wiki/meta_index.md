**Open Value Network** (OVN) is an approach to [[commons-based peer production]]. It allows individuals and organizations to 

* **co-create and aggregate** [[value]] through lateral and large scale coordination, cooperation and collaboration
* to serve as a responsible **steward** of commonly held wealth and assets
* to **account** for various inputs and outcomes in a common ledger system
* **distribute** value equitably and intentionally within and beyond the network
* and to share returns amongst contributors, in proportion to their [[contributions]]. 

The open value network model relies on [p2p principles of co-production, self-organization, and stewardship of commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_peer-to-peer_processes). 

* peer production - the collaborative production of surplus value by means of common and contributed assets;
* peer governance - direction and accountability by the community of producers themselves, not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy;
* peer property - the use-value of property is accessible on a collective trust basis through new modes of ownership which are not exclusive, while recognizing individual authorship or title where appropriate.

An OVN is a general model that can be implemented under different forms, adapted to specific contexts. 

Allow everyone to join and create [[value]] together in an open environment, enable mass-customization that will have a higher value than mass-production.  (Economies of scope vs. economies of scale) 

equipotentiality, anti-credentialism, self-selection, communal validation, and holoptism

# Background

The model was first proposed, developed and implemented by [[SENSORICA]] affiliates. SENSORICA was created in February 2011. Initially, the model evolved from the [Discovery Network](https://sites.google.com/site/multitudeinnovation/home/discovery-network) model proposed by [Tibi](https://plus.google.com/u/0/117593809719446924575/about) in 2009-2010. Between 2011 and 2012, the model drew from the work of [Verna Allee](http://www.vernaallee.com/valuenetworks.html), [Yochai Benkler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production), [Michel Bauwens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bauwens), [Clay Shirky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky), and others. After the summer of 2012, the value accounting and distributed resource management system was influenced by [Bob Haugen](https://plus.google.com/u/0/113885495827197979519/about) who has been working in this area since 1995.
Other organizations adopted the OVN model, like [http://metamaps.cc/ metamaps.cc].

From May 2013 to May 2014, [Yasir](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/siddiquiyasir/) worked on [a framework for open value network](http://sensoricablog.blogspot.ca/2013/11/blog-post.html) in collaboration with other [[SENSORICA]] affiliates. The OVN model was extended to network of networks, in the context of the [[[SENSORICA]] Open Alliance], which is a network-of-networks around [[SENSORICA]].
